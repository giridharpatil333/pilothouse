// StarterPolicy is written by `askgate policy init`. Every rule in it is
// a working example; tests compile it and check its behaviour.
const StarterPolicy = `# Askgate policy — applied before every tool call of every agent.

#   action: deny   block the call; the agent sees your message
#   action: ask    make a person confirm (the agent's own prompt at the desk,
#                  your phone when you're away)
#   action: allow  skip the agent's own permission prompt
#
# Precedence: if any matching rule says deny, the call is denied; else if any
# says ask, a person is asked; else allow. Order in this file only breaks ties.
# Built-in rule askgate-self-protection always asks before an agent runs
# askgate admin commands or edits Askgate/agent settings.
#
# match:  globs, all fields AND-ed. Fields: agent, tool, kind, command, path,
#         cwd, repo, branch. kind is one of shell, edit, read, web, mcp, other.
#         * ** ? {a,b}; a list means "any of". command globs see the whole
#         command line; path matches if any file the tool touches matches;
#         relative path globs match at any depth (".env" = "**/.env").
# when:   optional CEL expression, AND-ed with match. Variables: agent, tool,
